# AI Agent Resource Collection Simulation

A Unity-based experimental environment designed to test autonomous agent behavior in a competitive resource-gathering setting.  
Each agent operates independently, collects resources of varying values, and competes to achieve the highest total score.

## Objective

The project explores basic concepts of reinforcement learning and autonomous decision-making within a simplified 2D simulation.  
It demonstrates how agents can interact dynamically with their environment and adapt their behavior through logic-based control.

## Features

- Multiple AI agents with individual parameters (health, score, respawn logic).
- Resource system with distinct resource types and point values.
- Agentâ€“environment interaction via Unity 2D physics.
- Basic user interface for score and progress visualization.
- Optional human player mode for AI vs. player testing.

## Technical Overview

- **Engine:** Unity  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Core Concepts:** Autonomous systems, agent decision logic, environment feedback  
- **Simulation Type:** 2D grid-based environment  
- **Target Platform:** Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)

## Future Work

- Implement learning mechanisms (reinforcement-based updates).  
- Expand decision-making models and pathfinding.  
- Improve UI and analytics for agent performance tracking.  
- Introduce multiplayer or cooperative agent dynamics.
